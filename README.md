Introduction
Street food is a big part of many cultures around the world, known for being tasty,
cheap, and quick to get. It offers a fun and unique way to try local dishes, often right on
the streets. But while street food is loved for its flavor and price, people are often
worried about hygiene, cleanliness, and comfort when buying from roadside vendors.
These concerns can stop people from enjoying street food, even if they love the taste.
This project is all about creating a restaurant that brings the street food experience
indoors, offering the same great flavors in a cleaner, safer, and more comfortable
setting.

Problem Statement
The main problem with street food is the environment in which it is served. Street
food vendors usually operate in open-air spaces with limited access to sanitation. This
lack of hygiene can lead to food safety issues, which make people hesitant to eat from
roadside stalls. Also, street food is often served without any seating or indoor comfort,
which makes the experience less enjoyable for some customers. These problems need
to be addressed so that people can continue enjoying street food without worrying about
safety or comfort. Research has shown that poor food safety practices can increase
health risks (Macrojournal.org, 2023), highlighting the need for a solution that keeps the
food safe while maintaining its authentic taste.

Importance of the System
The idea behind this project is to create a restaurant that keeps the traditional
street food flavors while improving hygiene and comfort. The restaurant will ensure the
food is prepared in a clean environment with safe handling practices, giving customers
the comfort of indoor seating and a hygienic space to enjoy their meals. This solution is
important because it lets people experience street food in a way that addresses their
concerns about cleanliness and convenience. It combines the best of both worlds: the
authentic taste of street food with the safety and comfort of a restaurant setting. As
studies show, improving food safety and providing a more comfortable environment can
boost customer satisfaction (Macrojournal.org, 2023).

Objectives of the Project
The main goals of this project are to create a restaurant that serves street food in
a clean, comfortable, and safe environment. The specific objectives of the project are:
]Keep the Authentic Taste: The restaurant will serve traditional street food dishes,
ensuring the flavors stay true to what customers expect. Focus on Hygiene: The
restaurant will follow strict sanitation rules, ensuring that food is prepared and served in
a clean environment.Comfortable Setting: Customers will be able to sit inside in a
relaxed, comfortable space instead of eating outside on the street.Easy Access and
Convenience: The restaurant will have an easy-to-use website where customers can
view the menu, make reservations, and find the restaurant's details. Affordable Prices:
Despite the improvements in hygiene and comfort, the restaurant will keep the prices
affordable, making street food accessible to everyone.These goals aim to solve the
main problems with street food while offering a better, safer, and more enjoyable
experience for customers.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this project is about finding a way to enjoy street food in a clean,
safe, and comfortable setting. By creating a restaurant that offers the same great flavors
in a better environment, we can solve the problems of hygiene and lack of comfort that
many people face with traditional street food. The restaurant will offer a solution that
combines the best parts of street food with the safety and comfort of dining indoors.
This approach will help more people enjoy street food while making sure they feel safe
and comfortable while doing so.
